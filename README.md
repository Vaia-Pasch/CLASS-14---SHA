# CLASS-14---SHA
Digital Calendar with all the materials of the course "FrontEnd Web Development"

The purpose of this repository is to create a more practical access, if I may say, to the live sessions and the links shared in each live session.
If you think it's easier to search by the date of the session, or by the theme of the session (e.x. How the web works, Git hub starter, UX and UI) then this calendar could be useful. Also, it's a great opportunity for the class to work on it together and make it better step by step.

I would appreciate your help and your imagination. 

For start, I will use only HTML and CSS, but, if we can make it with JS that would be awesome.

I hope this is how README files work.

digital wink,
Vaia
